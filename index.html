          <h1>Wonder Coco International</h1>
          <p>Wonder Coco International (WCI) is a private company founded by five determined individuals in June 2019 that aims to reach the different corners of the world to share the wonder benefits of Virgin Coconut Oil. 
          Virgin Coconut oil, is one of the products of Philippine coconut market chains. It is an edible oil extracted from the kernel or meat of mature coconuts. Nowadays, consumers are becoming more health-conscious desiring to prefer organic products. Coconut oil is often described as the “healthiest oil on earth.” Virgin coconut oil is known for its nice fragrance, taste, antioxidants, medium chain fatty acids (MCFA), and vitamins, among others. VCO is known for less cholesterol content; reduces the blockage of blood vessels, reduces excess weight, boosts the immune system, and prevents premature aging.
          </p>
          <p>The Wonder Coco Virgin Coconut Oil is a product that will be self-produced and managed by the company in its own manufacturing plant in Batangas City, so that the quality of production is monitored and controlled. The funding for the production of VCO will be done through shareholder investments and financial grants from different agencies which will cover the capital, equipment, training for the members and provide a financial cushion for the operation.</p>
